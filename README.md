Zealous - An app for tracking live forex exchange rates and the Ghana stock exchange specifically built with 
         Ghanains in mind

### What is this repository for? ###

With this app, users can:

- Track Live forex exchange rates in an elegant interface
- Easily convert between any two currency pairs (The Ghanain cedi is the default currency

It uses the [openexchangerates](https://openexchangerates.org) api for exchange rates and

the stock data. See it [here]("https://bitbucket.org/yaa_aminu/zealous-backend/").
